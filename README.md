# SPOTIFY-CLONE
This project is a front-end clone of the Spotify music streaming interface, developed using only HTML and CSS. The main objective is to replicate the look and feel of Spotify's web application UI without any backend or JavaScript functionality, focusing purely on layout design, responsiveness, and styling.
